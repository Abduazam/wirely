# Laravel + Livewire + Flux UI Starter Kit

## Introduction

My favorite stack in Laravel used to be TALL — Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire. But after Caleb released UI components for Livewire, I started using FluxUI. So I decided to create a new starter kit based on the FALL stack — FluxUI, Alpine.js, Laravel, and Livewire.
